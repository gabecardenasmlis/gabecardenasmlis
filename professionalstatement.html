As an undergrad at UCLA from 2001 to 2005, I developed my interest into working at libraries through a student position in access services. I performed many of the day to day tasks such as shelving, attending the circulation desk, and eventually supervising crews of student stacks workers. Through this, I learned the ins and outs of the services provided by the library as well as gaining valuable experience as a supervisor. After I graduated in 2005, I accepted a position at the UCLA Southern Regional Library Facility (SRLF) as an incoming materials processor. At the SRLF I learned about proper storage conditions and climate controls for certain materials, and I also got my first introduction into library database systems such as Voyager and Orion. In May of 2007, I accepted what is now my current position within the UCLA Library Resource Acquisitions &amp; Metadata Services: Digital Resources Manager. As a digital resources manager, I control the workflow for digital resource requests, perform copy cataloging in OCLC Connexion, and complete various e-resource projects and packages using both MARC and non-MARC metadata formats. Working within the cataloging department for so many years has given me insight into the importance of accessibility regarding information resources and ultimately led me to applying for the MLIS program here at UCLA. I wanted to learn more about the field I had dedicated so much of my life to, and get out from behind a cubicle to work more face to face with people to help them with their informational needs.
</p><p>&nbsp;I’m a big believer in trying out things to not only learn more about what you do want to do, but also learn what you don’t want to do. I like to think that the classes I chose to take during this program helped me discover what I want to do after I graduate. In my first two quarters, I took some preservation and conservation classes thinking I might want to pursue archiving. These classes helped me realize that this track resembles what I am already doing professionally in cataloging: working more with objects and not so much with people and the public. In my third quarter, I switched gears and took librarianship classes. Here, is where I found my true passion: helping people find the information that they need, face to face. The courses Values and Communities, and Issues in Librarianship helped show me that marginalized and underserved populations are especially in need of adequate access to informational resources, and that they heavily rely on libraries to serve these needs. By the end of my first year, I knew that these are the populations I wanted to work with, which led me to community college librarianship.
</p><p>In the summer of 2019, I volunteered at the reference desk of the Los Angeles City College Martin Luther King Jr. Library. I used this time to gain experience for my internship that I was scheduled to do in the fall at this library. Through volunteering and interning at the MLK library, I was able to pick the brains of both full-time and adjunct community college librarians. In 2019, I joined the UCLA Library Equity Diversion and Inclusion Committee to learn more about helping underserved populations. Also, in 2019 I attended a two-day library carpentry workshop (provided by the UCLA Library) to gain familiarity with some computer programs I may need to use as a full-time librarian. These programs included Unix Shell, Python, Open Refine, and Jupyter Notebook. Regarding my desire for future employment at a community college, in the fall of 2019 I attended a professional development event hosted by UCLA Graduate Career Services which consisted of a Q&amp;A with a panel of representatives from various community colleges around Southern California. At this event, I had the opportunity to talk in person with a human resources representative from the Los Angeles College District to discuss the application process for adjunct librarians in LACCD. In January of 2020 I attended a hiring fair hosted by California Community Colleges and attended workshops about the interview process for CCC. I also met community college librarians from Pasadena City College and Mt. San Antonio College and discussed their hiring processes, and also potential job openings in the future.
</p><p>Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected my career plans after I graduate. To further familiarize myself with community college libraries and learn more directly from professionals in the field, my intent was to do an internship with Southwest College in spring quarter of 2020. This internship was cancelled due to mass library closures throughout LACCD. This summer, I was also planning on returning to volunteer with Los Angeles City College and resume my work at the reference desk. It was my hope to focus on bibliographic instruction and gain more experience with that facet of the job. I will not be able to do this until the pandemic is over. However, I do intend on applying to LACCD to become an adjunct librarian and get into the hiring pool as soon as I acquire my MLIS degree. Adjunct librarians are part-time so I plan on keeping my job at UCLA while putting in some hours at community college library reference desks, should I get into the hiring pool. If I get offered a full-time position as a community college librarian, with a heavy heart, I will move on from my career at UCLA. While working with community college librarians at LACC, I learned about incentives to continue professional development for those that obtain a librarian position at one of the nine colleges within the Los Angeles Community College District. Librarians can move up one level on the payroll scale for every 20 units of college coursework they complete after they obtain their MLIS. I intend to take classes to supplement my skills as a librarian such as classes on website development, computer programming, and education and teaching courses. I also plan to join the American Library Association and attend their annual conferences to learn more about innovations in the profession and pick the brains of other librarians from around the country. In summation, I expect my educational journey to continue far beyond UCLA graduate program.
</p><p>I truly believe that my professional development began when I decided to apply to graduate school here at UCLA, after a thirteen-year hiatus from higher education. My goal was to learn more about information studies and find a career path that I am not only passionate about, but that best utilizes the skills I have acquired through past employment. By carefully selecting my classes and internships, I feel that I have achieved this.
