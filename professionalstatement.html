            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-12"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that in order to discuss where I would like to go professionally into the field of information studies, I need to </p><p>first discuss where I have been. As an undergrad at UCLA from 2001 to 2005, I developed my interest into working at </p><p>libraries through a student position in access services. I performed many of the day to day tasks such as shelving, </p><p>attending the circulation desk, and eventually supervising crews of student stacks workers. Through this, I learned the </p><p>ins and outs of the services provided by the library as well as gaining valuable experience as a supervisor. After I </p><p>graduated in 2005, I accepted a position at the UCLA Southern Regional Library Facility (SRLF) as an incoming materials </p><p>processor. At the SRLF, I learned about proper storage conditions and climate controls for certain materials, and I also got </p><p>my first introduction into library database systems such as Voyager and Orion. In May of 2007, I accepted what is now my </p><p>current position, Digital Resources Manager for the UCLA Library Resource Acquisitions &amp; Metadata Services </p><p>Department. As a digital resources manager, I control the workflow for digital resource requests, perform copy cataloging </p><p>through OCLC <em>Connexion</em>, and complete various e-resource projects and packages using both MARC and non-MARC </p><p>metadata formats. Working within the cataloging department for so many years has given me insight into the importance </p><p>of accessibility regarding information resources and ultimately led me to applying for the MLIS program here at UCLA. I </p><p>wanted to learn more about the field I had dedicated so much of my life to, get out from behind a cubicle, and work more </p><p>face to face with people and help them with their information needs.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I’m a big believer in trying out things to not only learn more about what you do want to do, but also learn what </p><p>you don’t want to do. I truly believe that the classes I chose to take during this program helped me discover what I want </p><p>to do in my professional life. In my first two quarters, I took mostly preservation and conservation classes thinking I might </p><p>want to pursue archiving. These classes helped me realize that this track resembles what I am already doing </p><p>professionally in cataloging: working more with materials and less with people and the public. In my third quarter, I </p><p>switched gears and took mostly librarianship classes. Here, is where I found my true passion: helping people find the </p><p>information that they need, face to face. The courses Values and Communities, and Issues in Librarianship helped show </p><p>me that marginalized and underserved populations are especially in need of adequate access to informational resources, </p><p>and that they heavily rely on libraries to serve these needs. By the end of my first year, I knew that these are the </p><p>populations I wanted to work with, which led me to community college librarianship.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the summer of 2019, I volunteered at the reference desk of the Los Angeles City College Martin Luther King Jr. </p><p>Library. I used this time to gain experience for my internship that I was scheduled to do in the fall at this same library. </p><p>Through volunteering and interning at the MLK library, I was able to pick the brains of both full-time and adjunct </p><p>community college librarians. They gave me great advice on how to search and apply for jobs after I graduate. In the fall </p><p>of 2019, I&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">joined the UCLA Library Equity Diversion and Inclusion Committee to learn more about helping underserved </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">populations.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Also, in 2019 I attended a two-day library carpentry workshop (provided by the UCLA Library) to gain </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">familiarity with some&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">computer programs I may need to use as a full-time librarian. These programs included Unix Shell, </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Python, Open Refine,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">and Jupyter Notebook. Regarding my desire for future employment at a community college, in the </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">fall of 2019 I attended&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">a professional development event hosted by UCLA Graduate Career Services which consisted of a </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Q&amp;A with a panel of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">representatives from various community colleges around Southern California. At this event, I had the </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">opportunity to talk&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">in person with a human resources representative from the Los Angeles College District to discuss the </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">application process &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">for adjunct librarians in LACCD. In January of 2020 I attended a hiring fair hosted by California </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Community Colleges and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">attended workshops about the interview process for CCC. I also met community college </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">librarians from Pasadena City&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">College and Mt. San Antonio College and discussed their hiring processes, and potential job </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">openings in the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">future.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected my career plans after I graduate. To further </p><p>familiarize myself with community college libraries and learn more directly from professionals in the field, my intent was </p><p>to do an internship with Southwest College in spring quarter of 2020. This internship was cancelled due to mass library </p><p>closures throughout LACCD. This summer, I was also planning on returning to volunteer with Los Angeles City College </p><p>and resume my work at the reference desk. It was my hope to focus on bibliographic instruction and gain more </p><p>experience with that facet of the job. Sadly, I will not be able to do this until the pandemic is over. However, I do intend on </p><p>applying to LACCD to become an adjunct librarian and get into the hiring pool as soon as I acquire my MLIS degree. </p><p>Adjunct librarians are part-time so I plan on keeping my job at UCLA while putting in some hours at community college </p><p>library reference desks, should I get into the hiring pool. While working with community college librarians at LACC, I </p><p>learned about incentives to continue professional development for those that obtain a librarian position at one of the nine </p><p>colleges within the Los Angeles Community College District. Librarians can move up one level on the payroll scale for </p><p>every 20 units of college coursework they complete after they obtain their MLIS. I intend to take classes to supplement </p><p>my skills as a librarian such as classes on website development, computer programming, and education and teaching </p><p>courses. I also plan to join the American Library Association and attend their annual conferences to learn more about </p><p>innovations in the profession as well as meet other librarians from around the country. In summation, I expect my </p><p>educational journey to continue far beyond my UCLA graduate program.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I honestly feel that my professional development began when I decided to apply to graduate school at UCLA. My </p><p>goal was to learn more about information studies and find a career path that I am not only passionate about, but that </p><p>best utilizes the skills I have acquired through past employment. By carefully selecting my classes and internships, I </p><p>believe that I have achieved this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><div><strong><br></strong></div><p></p></div>
